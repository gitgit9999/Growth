## Growth mindset

**How you can benefit from a growth mindset**: 
The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself “Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”

Why? The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better. And you can, too.


#### Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

* Growing at work, and outside work too

 I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.
 
 * Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset
